There are three critical subsheets. The given data is of the performance of individuals a particular team. The data has three components- each subsheet has one component			
						
# Overview of the Subsheets	

Performance Scorecard	"1) How satisfied is the owner/ founder of the company regards to the individual's progress? 

The project leads measure the contribution of the student unicorns every week. This frequent feedback accelerates the Student Unicorn's learning and thus fuels their growth"		
			
Happiness Scorecard	"2) How happy each employees is, while working in this company?

Student Unicorns fill this happiness report every week. They introspect on their work life balance. The team members reflect in a breakout room and fill the Happiness Scorecard.                                                        "		
			
Progress Report	"3) Candidate productivity data

The student unicorns get a new format every week. A new theme every week helps them reflective in different ways and thus mature faster"
